- 11/1/23
- Descriptions:
  - 10/30: Got majority of the styling done up until Amenities. Wasn't able to figure out the alignment of it.
  - 10/31: Finished majority of the styling and started the alignment of the text to make it 1 to 1. Fixed the card borders, and changed the spacing between the bullet points and the text. Figured out majority of the alignment, such as the input fields and the text above.
  - 11/1: Was able to crop most of the images using object-fit and object-position. Started on the responsiveness for tablet/medium.
