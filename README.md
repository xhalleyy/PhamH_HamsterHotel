# PhamH_HamsterHotel

The navbar headings are linked to portions(ids) of the page, so it'll go downwards to what heading you click. For tablet/phone or med/small breakpoints, the room cards go into a horizontal scroll. You can use your trackpad or hold left click and drag left and right. You can also tap the scroll bar.

- Descriptions:
  - 10/30: Got majority of the styling done up until Amenities. Wasn't able to figure out the alignment of it.
  - 10/31: Finished majority of the styling and started the alignment of the text to make it 1 to 1. Fixed the card borders, and changed the spacing between the bullet points and the text. Figured out majority of the alignment, such as the input fields and the text above.
  - 11/1: Was able to crop most of the images using object-fit and object-position. Started on the responsiveness for tablet/medium. 
  - 11/2: Did majority of responsiveness by hiding containers/blocks and making them visible 
  - 11/3: Fixed styling of offcanvas navbar, i.e. coloring, font

  - Feedback: You did a really great job! Everything looks good and I like how you stylized everything in mobile and tablet versions. The scroll for the rooms is a great touch. I like how you added a carousel for the amenities also. Linking the buttons to the actual part on your site was great also. :-)
